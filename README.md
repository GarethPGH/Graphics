# Graphics
A repository for some graphics projects I have done, in Desc Order


2018 Dog_icon: A .jpg preview with an orange background to make the face of the dog stand out for viewing purposes of a .ico file for FindMyPet. Created with Gimp. Intended to be the App icon.

July 2018 Waterdeer: Scratchboard medium with Watercolor overlay on flowers. I'm a traditional artist by nature.
This was the first full-sheet Scratchboard commission I did.

May 2018 Jim n Beans: Business card logo I designed for coworkers of mine who intended to open a bakery. I also designed business cards and logos for them for order forms. I also offered to do a website, but they were going to wait till they had an operating business beyond home sales. I do not know if they ever did open that bakery. Design made using open source program Gimp.

2016 Roxo Mk Commission: This is the first full scale digital commission I ever made. Client wanted his character put into the Mortal Kombat X character selection screen. There was only one picture availible at the time, of the then, protoype, of the game to use as a reference. Every aspect: his character, the locked character icons, his character icon, the different variations icons, were all hand drawn in Photoshop and then resized to fit the background, also drawn from reference. The variations icons were merged into their own element before that was pasted into the final piece. I created an unseen grid layer to help with layout. I originally created an unfinished horizontal layout that I discarded in favor of the vertical alignment because of the fact that it covered so much of his character. A separate foreground layer was used for atmospheric effects to place his character into the game scene. Original layout can be seen in RoxoMkCommissionRejectedLayout.

2016 MonetGallery: An unfinished web project with semi-working gallery layout. The code for it can be seen in the MoNet repo that I worked with LikeClockwork. https://github.com/GarethPGH/MoNET/tree/master/MoNETGallery

2015 Lavender Calculator: All of the aspects of this image were created by me in Photoshop and arranged using the Visual Studio Forms Designer. However, code was originally taken from the net and modified to create functionality. Code can be seen here: https://github.com/GarethPGH/Lavender-Calculator

2014 Dragonwolves Icon: Icon I designed in Photoshop for the Dragonwolves Clan in the game Warframe. The lotus symbol is copyright Digital Extremes and was used with permission to design the clan symbol.

2014 Mural of the City of Pittsburgh: Acrylic paint on lightly stucco wall. Measures approx 10' by 7'. Original concept was drawn up after doing practice sketches of buildings, on posterboard. References were from a book about the city and pictures of the older hockey and football stadiums that are no longer standing (as per client request). From when I started painting to finish, the project took about 64 hours. 

2012 Meadlabel: Design I made for a label I made for the family mead. Although we never actually sold any mead, it was used on presents for family and friends.

2009 Off to War: This is from a time when I was unable to actually draw using Photoshop. From a contest for an artist who wanted pieces done with her species, the Fuji. Themes were left up to the artists who participated. As such, clothing, ships, water feature and city were my design. This was colored using Photoshop under a scan of my original ink drawing.
