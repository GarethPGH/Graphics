A repository for some graphics projects I have done, in Desc Order

**2019 Gryphon Commission:** Picture made for a client of a sci-fi theme, involving a mad scientist and his character, the samurai gryphon. 
 
**2018 Dog_icon:** A .jpg preview with an orange background to make the face of the dog stand out for viewing purposes of a .ico file for FindMyPet. Original has a transparent background. Created with Gimp. Intended to be the App icon.

**2018 Waterdeer:** Scratchboard medium with Watercolor overlay on flowers. This was the first full-sheet Scratchboard commission I did.

**2018 Jim n Beans:** Business card logo I designed for coworkers of mine who intended to open a bakery. I also designed business cards and logos for them for order forms. I also offered to do a website, but they were going to wait till they had an operating business beyond home sales. I do not know if they ever did open that bakery. Design made using open source program Gimp.

**2016 Roxo Mk Commission:** Client wanted his character put into the Mortal Kombat X character selection screen. There was only one picture availible of the then, protoype, of the game to use as a reference. Every aspect: his character, the locked character icons, his character icon, different variations icons, were all hand drawn in Photoshop, and then resized to fit the background. The variations icons were merged into their own element before that was pasted into the final piece. I created an unseen grid layer to help with layout. I originally created an unfinished horizontal layout that I discarded in favor of the vertical alignment because of the fact that it covered so much of his character. A separate foreground layer was used for atmospheric effects to place his character into the game scene. Original layout can be seen in RoxoMkCommissionRejectedLayout.

**2016 Heather's Baby Shower:** Graphic I made for tiny jar candle logos intended as gifts at a baby shower. The prints were to be no more than about an inch wide. Client originally wanted a girl "minion" from the Illumination: Minions movie. Design was later rejected, in favor of simpler lettering, due to fears it would be too detailed for such a small print.
 
**2016 MonetGallery:** An unfinished web project with semi-working gallery layout. The code for it can be seen in the MoNet repo. Part of a larger project, where I helped two other developers design and test a robotic painting canvas. https://github.com/GarethPGH/MoNET/tree/master/MoNETGallery

**2015 Lavender Calculator:** All of the aspects of this image were created by me in Photoshop and arranged using the Visual Studio Forms Designer. However, code was originally taken from the net and modified to create functionality. Code can be seen here: https://github.com/GarethPGH/Lavender-Calculator

**2014 Dragonwolves Icon:** Icon designed in Photoshop for the Dragonwolves Clan in the game Warframe. The lotus symbol is copyright Digital Extremes and was used with permission to design the clan symbol.

**2014 Mural of the City of Pittsburgh:** Acrylic paint on lightly stucco wall. Measures approx 10' by 7'. Original concept was drawn up after doing practice sketches of buildings, on posterboard. References were from a book about the city and pictures of the older hockey and football stadiums that are no longer standing (as per client request). From when I started painting to finish, the project took about 64 hours. 

**2012 Meadlabel:** Design I made for a label I made for the family mead. Although we never actually sold any mead, it was used on presents for family and friends.

**2010 Blue Devil** Design for the Bauerstown Blue Devils' little league parade banner. Included as an example of custom lettering. Done using InkScape.  
 
**2009 Otter:** Picture done as a gift. Despite being an older work, included here as an example of color coordination and background, because I still like the way I did the corals.

**2009 Off to War:** This is from a time when I was unable to draw linework using Photoshop. For a contest for an artist who wanted pieces done with her species, the Fuji. Themes were left up to the participants. As such, clothing, ships, water feature and city were my design. This was colored using Photoshop under a scan of my original ink drawing.
