# Graphics
A repository for some graphics projects I have done, in Desc Order

July 2018 Waterdeer: Scratchboard medium with Watercolor overlay on flowers. I'm a traditional artist by nature.
This was the first full-sheet Scratchboard commission I did.

May 2018 Jim n Beans: Business card logo I designed for coworkers of mine who intended to open a bakery. I also designed business cards and logos for them for order forms. I also offered to do a website, but they were going to wait till they had an operating business beyond home sales. I do not know if they ever did open that bakery. Design made using open source program Gimp.

2016 Roxo Mk Commission: This is the first full scale digital commission I ever made. Client wanted his character put into the Mortal Kombat X character selection screen. There was only one picture availible at the time, of the then, protoype, of the game to use as a reference. Every aspect: his character, the locked character icons, his character icon, the different variations icons, were all hand drawn in Photoshop and then resized to fit the background, also drawn from reference. The variations icons were merged into their own element before that was pasted into the final piece. I created an unseen grid layer to help with layout. I originally created an unfinished horizontal layout that I discarded in favor of the vertical alignment because of the fact that it covered so much of his character. A separate foreground layer was used for atmospheric effects to place his character into the game scene.
